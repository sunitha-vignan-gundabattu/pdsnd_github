### Date created
This project was created by me on 4th September 2022 as part of the Udacity nanodegree project pertaining to version control.

### Project Title
Udacity Bikeshare Python Project

### Description
This project is being created to analyze data for the bikeshare systems in cities like Chicago, New York and Washington. The script has been written using Python that reads bikeshare data from csv files pertaining to the three cities specified above. It provides statistics on US bikeshare users for the count of user types, count of gender, the earliest most recent and most common year of birth, the total and mean travel time, the most frequent combination of start station and end station trip, and statistics on the most frequent times of travel.

### Files used
There are three datasets used in this project. These pertain to bikeshare data from cities like Chicago, New York and Washington.
chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv

### Credits
I thank Udacity for giving me an opportunity to learn and work on the latest technologies including Python, Pandas and Numpy libraries and Version Control using GitHub. The step by step procedures and contents in the online course helped me successfully upload my own project to Git. Thanks.
